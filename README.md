# GradeModel

## About The Project

GradeModel is an open source tool designed to make grading easier for writing teachers. Our mission is not to replace the teacher, but to make grading faster. We believe that with the aid of natural language processing, teachers can provide faster feedback, that at the same time, is still effective and personalized for all students.
